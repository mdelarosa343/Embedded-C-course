# Howdy! 
If you are reading this, you are most likely an engineer here to review my progress in the Udemy course on bare-metal embedded C I am going through. Sit back, relax, and observe, as I attempt to speedrun what would amount to multiple computer science courses in a matter of weeks.

I may not be a coding genius (yet), but I hope this repo shows I'm willing and able to put in the hard work and learn new skills quickly. So whether you're here to offer a helping hand or just to see how far I can push myself, I'm grateful for your presence. 

# Organization scheme
I'm going to try and keep this repo fairly organized (no promises). The master branch is probably going to be the only branch, just so that I can simplify things for myself, but I can also do some sort of branch structure if you guys think it's necessary. I have never used Github before, so if you have any tips and tricks that you know about the platform that you think I should know, feel free to reach out to me.
